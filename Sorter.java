    /* future ones
     * radix
     * quick sort
     * swap sort (something like that)
     * 
     * u gotta make ur own
     * kyleSort
     * short description:
     * data management
     * 
     * Sample method - systematic cluster
     * we pick out any outliers in a sample space
     * outliers are considered things with a 5% standard deviation
     * 
     * since we know at index 0, height should be 10, and at index 5 height should be 60, 
     * no i want to compare relative to one another
     * 
     * to be 100% i want make my own algorithm and fuck with ppl
     * 
     future plans, sort the pillars into binomial distribution (or as close as u can get)
     unrealistic as it lokos like -Math.abs(x) (pyramid shape)
     * 
     * we ship this shit off to outlier pile
     *
